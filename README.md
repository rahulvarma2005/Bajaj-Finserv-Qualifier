# Bajaj Finserv Health - Java Qualifier Challenge

This project is a Spring Boot application built to solve the Bajaj Finserv Health Qualifier 1 challenge. The application automates a workflow that involves retrieving a dynamic SQL challenge, solving it, and submitting the solution to a webhook, all triggered on application startup.

## üìã Task Overview

The core task is to build a Spring Boot application that:
1.  **Initiates on Startup**: The entire process runs automatically when the application starts, with no need for manual triggers or API endpoints.
2.  **Fetches the Challenge**: It sends a `POST` request with registration details to a specified endpoint to receive a unique webhook URL, a JWT access token, and a SQL problem.
3.  **Solves the SQL Problem**: It prepares the correct SQL query based on the assigned problem.
4.  **Submits the Solution**: It sends the final SQL query as a `POST` request to the received webhook URL, using the JWT token for authorization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is contained within the `ChallengeRunner.java` class, which implements `CommandLineRunner`. This ensures the process is executed as soon as the Spring application context is loaded.

1.  **Registration**: A `POST` request containing the candidate's name, registration number, and email is sent to `https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/generateWebhook/JAVA`.
2.  **Response Handling**: The application parses the JSON response to extract the `webhookUrl` and `accessToken`.
3.  **Query Preparation**: The final SQL query for the assigned problem is stored as a string.
4.  **Submission**: A final `POST` request is made to the dynamic `webhookUrl`. The request includes the `accessToken` in the `Authorization` header and the SQL query in the JSON body.
